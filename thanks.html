		<p class="about">
			Thank you so much for choosing Eventful Eats to give you the party of your dreams! We will be reaching out to you
			soon to schedule a meeting time to discuss more details. We discuss budget more once we meet. The payment we just took
			was to have a card on file for retainer fees. If you have any questions feel free to reach out at anytime. We also have an office if you would like to speak with one of us directly. Our 
			dream is to make yours come to life so we are here when you need us. Our hours and office location are listed under
			our contact us/hire us tab!
